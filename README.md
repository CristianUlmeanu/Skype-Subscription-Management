# Skype-Subscription-Management
I've created this OOP project to manage multiple types of subscriptions.

University project with the purpose of using OOP concepts. It is created to manage the skype subscription of a group of persons. The project has integrated an interactive menu that controls all the class methods such as: inserting data, viewing data, viewing person based on the name, creating an auxiliary class type agenda with the option to view it or just pure testing of the classes. I've implemented concepts such as static variables and methods, concepts of upcasting and downcasting done in a late binding manner.
